# Overview
The Interactive Text Classification of Reviews & Literature project aims to classify text data from reviews and horror literature using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The application features an interactive visualization interface built with HTML, allowing users to explore and interact with classification results. The project also provides detailed insights into model predictions, feature importance, and performance metrics.

# Features
Text Classification: Utilizes NLP techniques to classify text from reviews and horror literature.
Interactive Visualization: A web interface built with HTML to explore and interact with classification results.
Model Insights: Provides detailed insights into model predictions, feature importance, and performance metrics.
Text Preprocessing: Uses NLTK for text preprocessing, including the use of the English stopwords list to improve classification accuracy.

# Tech Stack
Python 2.7: Programming language used for implementing the classification model.
Flask: Web framework used for creating the interactive web interface.
tarfile: For handling data archives.
scikit-learn: Machine learning library used for implementing classification algorithms.
matplotlib: Library for creating visualizations.
